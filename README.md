Certainly! Here's an example of GitHub code that demonstrates how to perform safety toolbox talks, review previous day's jobs, schedule a new job, and follow up with the maintenance team:

python
Copy code
import datetime

class SafetyToolboxTalk:
    def __init__(self, topic, attendees):
        self.topic = topic
        self.attendees = attendees
        self.date = datetime.date.today()

    def conduct_toolbox_talk(self):
        # Code to conduct the safety toolbox talk
        print(f"Conducting Safety Toolbox Talk on {self.date} on the topic: {self.topic}")
        print(f"Attendees: {', '.join(self.attendees)}")
        print("Discussion points:")
        # Add discussion points here

class Job:
    def __init__(self, job_id, description):
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.description = description

    def execute_job(self):
        # Code to execute the job
        print(f"Executing Job {self.job_id}: {self.description}")

class MaintenanceTeam:
    def __init__(self, team_name, members):
        self.team_name = team_name
        self.members = members

    def review_previous_day_jobs(self):
        # Code to review previous day's jobs
        print(f"Reviewing previous day's jobs by {self.team_name} team:")
        # Add code to fetch and display previous day's jobs

    def schedule_new_job(self, job):
        # Code to schedule a new job
        print(f"Scheduling a new job for {job.job_id}: {job.description}")

    def follow_up_jobs(self):
        # Code to follow up on executed jobs
        print(f"Following up on executed jobs by {self.team_name} team:")
        # Add code to fetch and display executed jobs

# Example usage
toolbox_talk = SafetyToolboxTalk("Electrical Safety", ["John", "Jane", "Alice"])
toolbox_talk.conduct_toolbox_talk()

job1 = Job("123", "Install new equipment")
job1.execute_job()

team = MaintenanceTeam("Electrical Maintenance", ["Mike", "Sarah", "Tom"])
team.review_previous_day_jobs()

job2 = Job("456", "Repair faulty wiring")
team.schedule_new_job(job2)

team.follow_up_jobs() Engineering-corner-
